      <h1>Why?</h1>
      <article>
    <p class="first_paragraph">Just B Kause we know how important is it to help people in the Orange County community who are down on their luck. We also know how hard it is for an Orange County Charity to keep their doors open so that they can provide valuable services to those in need.</p>
    <p>We also know that Orange County is one of the most affluent counties in the United States. There are a lot of generous people who want to give back to their community, but don't know how.
    </p>
    <p>That's where Just B Kause comes in. We help connect volunteers and donors with organizations in need. Plus, we have a strong presence at many local events. Proceeds that we earn at these family-oriented events go to local charities so that they can continue their fine work.
